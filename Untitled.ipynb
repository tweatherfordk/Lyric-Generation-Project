       " 'Morning Pages: 10/04/16 LyricsMuch to do. Preparing for New York Comicon and finalizing some story elements in order to get a jump on things.\\nI don\\'t get my news anymore from twitter so I\\'ve had to seek other alternatives like the Apple News app but I find myself compulsively checking it sometimes. I\\'m working on breaking those kind of habits. I think it has a lot to do with how important this election is. I\\'m almost 40 and I can\\'t remember a time in my life where voting felt so extremely vital. I, like many people, used to feel that voting didn\\'t matter, but I\\'ve come around on it. I basically said to myself, \"Let\\'s say that you are 99% right that voting doesn\\'t matter, but there is the 1% chance you are wrong…\".\\nI\\'m voting for the 1% chance that I was wrong back in the day. I\\'m voting because we must do what we can. In fact, sometimes, all you have is your vote. Sure, you can be involved in other ways, like writing your elected officials, protesting, petitions, and things of that nature- and they do work sometimes, as we’ve just seen with the DEA temporarily lifting a ban on a plant that helps people that are addicted to opioids wean themselves off. This is a step in the right direction, at least for now, and maybe one day the DEA will finally break the cycle of representing the best interests of Big Pharma, as a growing number of people are becoming hip to that which has been going on for many years. Too many people are gripped in the powerful hold of prescription painkillers, and we need to seek every alternative option as the corporations continue to lobby for getting more pills in our hands. Our pain makes them rich, so they see no reason to stop. And my heart goes out to people who are caught in this situation.\\nBut, in my opinion, I feel it comes down to the vote you are allowed. And we are allowed to vote in other ways other than politically. Disagree with some form of entertainment? You can vote by not throwing money at it. Want to see something succeed? You can do the opposite, and say it with the funds you are allowed. Vocal support can be helpful at times, but with the way the world works, the only thing the powers that be seem to understand is either cash or votes. That has been my understanding from taking note of how things do actually change over time. We need to put the right people in office. We need to support the teams and artists that speak to us.\\nSo voting is important, and I urge you to do it. If you think it doesn\\'t matter, just do it for the 1% chance you might be wrong.Embed': 63,\n",

       " 'Pogi’s Cavern Lyrics[Spoken]\\n\\nLocated just twelve miles from Pine Swallow, South Dakota, Pogi\\'s Cavern boasts one of the most interesting array of rust formations, stalactites. This follows a small assortment of crystal formations and creatures unique to its series of caves. Reaching depths of 1,996 miles, only 173 of them have been mapped out by researchers, spelunkers, and geologists, like the Carson family. This is due to its treacherous and unpredictable drop-offs, razor-sharp stalagmites, and semi-gelatinous poison lakes, which produce gas that can cause disorientation, leaving many explorers lost, succumbing to starvation, and eventually, madness. First thing you\\'ll notice upon entering Pogi\\'s Cavern is a faint hum, at a low frequency, emitting from its walls. Closer inspection reveals that if one touches the walls, they will notice a sensation, not unlike receiving a hand massage from an Olympic shot-putter. This can can cause a sense of unease, and the hum itself can cause form of indigestion or nausea. Over here, we\\'ll find a wonderful array of hovanite crystals, growing right out of the side of that wall. In 1906, upon discovering the cavern, Marcel Bakerson was recorded as saying of the crystals, \"These look like the teeth of the Lord and Savior,\" and from that point on, became known as Jesus Teeth. Though the members of the Bakerson expedition succumbed to unexplainable inflammations of the lower intestine, eventually dying, their discoveries still benefit us today, as hovanite is commonly used as a pet food sweetener, and aids in gerbil fertility. Many arthropods inhabit Pogi\\'s Cavern, and enjoy the benefits of dwelling in a cave system, rich with fungus. Like the susupede, which possesses twelve hundred legs, and excretes a sticky fluid, called shamakan, known in geologic circles as \\'night pudding\\', a substance that produces vivid hallucinations if ingested. Looks like our little multi-legged friend thinks that microphone is its mother. Isn\\'t that funny? Further into the network of caves is one of the largest natural grottoes in recorded history. Known as the \\'Starboard Grotto\\', due to its glimmering, birdlike erosion discoloration all over its limestone enclosures, this could be called the most peaceful setting known in the cavern, and one can\\'t help but feel the worries of the world slip out from under you. A calm now rides through the grotto, and causes one to marvel at the wonders; birth from the chaos of creation, a positive sense of self, pervasive pure, our perceptions of what is real, and what is not yet real but fully possible, overwhelms us, invalidates our dreams, our hopes, and our questions for the universe.2Embed': 275,\n",

       " 'Afternoon Pages: 12/28/16 LyricsAfternoon Pages\\nIt’s been a moment. And a trying time since October when we last spoke. I basically hit a point where I didn’t feel like I had anything constructive to contribute, so I made myself scarce. I really needed to do some thinking and growing, and the last couple years have definitely been a journey of personal growth. Lots to learn, always learning. It did always seem like something was coming up in the world news that kept contributing to my absence. And I feel like I should clarify that I’m talking about world events and not personal life events. After getting over a hump, I have been the most mentally healthy I could possibly be in a long time. I definitely hit a new place, a stronger place. My family and I have been extremely lucky as far as our personal year has gone, and we are grateful. Healthy and happy—you can’t ask for much else.\\nI appreciate that people have been respecting my space in terms of not being on twitter so I can focus on work and myself. My mental health thanks you.\\nBut it did seem like something was always coming up, getting in the way of communication. Over the years, I just think this is how I operate—sometimes I’m around, and sometimes I’m not. I used to attribute the times when I was around to manic episodes, and then the times when I am gone to depressed phases, but I think it’s a little more basic than that. I think I just have a limit to how available I can make myself over long periods of time, especially when I’m learning things. So, I think my life will always be a series of disappearing and reappearing acts. I’m at peace with that.\\nCarrie Fisher. That was a kind of wake up call. It was another moment where I felt like just closing myself off again. Of course, like many people, I am a big fan of her work on screen, and she contributed a great deal to my childhood, but it was also her advocacy for mental health, her outspoken critique of celebrity and industry, and her openness about addiction that I always respected tremendously. And her way of being inspired me, opening the doors to talk about mental health. Even recently, I didn’t think labels were healthy in regards how it can position you to be some sort of tool for someone else’s agenda, but I have come to accept that sometimes, facing exactly what you are can be very liberating—it takes the power away from the bogeyman. I will miss her dearly. And George Michael—a booming voice, an amazing talent, and a quietly charitable individual. Watching him struggle over the years with being in the public eye had been difficult, and eventually something I think everyone can now relate to, us all being in the public eye constantly. He inspired me in many ways. And we lost so many amazing and talented people this year, my thoughts are with all of them.\\nSo yeah, I just woke up today and felt like communicating. It didn’t seem like things in the world were going to get good enough for me to open a door to step through to talk to you, so I just had to force the door open. I burned some sage and cleansed the demons and sat down and started writing this.\\nI have been extremely focused and busy with writing Doom Patrol and heading Young Animal. We are a little late at the moment with Doom Patrol, so I am doing my best to stay on top of things and Nick is working hard to make sure we can produce the best possible book for you guys. Through all of the work we still connect every day and fan the sparks of our ideas. The fire is very real there, and the thing that keeps us going and fighting hard is knowing that we have amazing things to share with you guys, so thank you so much for understanding that sometimes things take a little extra time. I have also been able to re-engage with Umbrella Academy as I catch up on Doom. Doom Patrol is a monthly book, so sometimes it forces you to make it a priority, and Umbrella Academy is a series of mini-arcs that come out when they are ready, so you can see the conflict there. Aside from working on myself mentally, I’ve also had to start adjusting to new ways of working, constantly striving to raise my output. I have always been detail-obsessed and perfection-oriented, so it takes a little learning to let things out into the world. You can only labor over something so long. I don’t think I’ve ever finished an album or a comic, they just come out when they have to.\\nMusic—I’ll start with my music. I am always writing music, I am very lucky that way—there is always an idea and something that inspires me, even if it takes me a minute to figure out what I want to say, which is what really creates the space between releases. I am about to convert a structure on our property into a recording studio, which actually won’t take a lot of work as the space is already pretty perfect. Great drums sounds and church ceilings. Secret echo chambers. I look forward to making some really weird stuff here, and mine for the really hard to get diamonds. Moving into the new year, my focus will become split into music and comics, now that Young Animal is running well (thanks to Molly and Jamie’s hard work, and Dan and Jim’s support) it gives me more breathing room to make sounds, some of which may even be connected to the comics. But we will continue to expand Young Animal and it has been made known to me that the imprint is an essential part of DC Comics moving forward. That is a nice feeling. I’m excited to keep doing it.\\nAs far as music as it relates to my process and the things I have been working on, I have been creating comics almost exclusively while listening to Alessandro Cortini, an analog/digital artist and musician that creates these amazing soundscapes and melodies. You should check out Forse 1-3, though I love absolutely everything he does and it’s all worth a look. It has been the total soundtrack as I come to a close on writing the first 6 issue arc of Doom Patrol. It helps my head breathe. I even listen to it in the morning when I drive Bandit to school so it starts my brain in the right place. And a friend of mine has just turned me onto this amazing band called Culture Abuse, and their album, Peach, is in fact a peach. Their single also has the image of a brick on it, and bricks, especially lone bricks, are very important to the story I am currently writing. Sometimes the universe lines up like that.2Embed': 278,\n",

       " 'Morning Pages: 9/30/16 LyricsHad a great day of writing yesterday. I have noticed that I need to be pushed to the absolute limit to have the breakthrough I need to make a meaningful issue. It is like this, every single time. It gets very dark, you feel you\\'ll never crack the story-- you have dragged yourself into the dangerous realm of possible defeat and you never know if you\\'re going to pull off a daring escape. Always painted in corners, always balancing a delicate collection of information and feelings. Maybe it\\'s a sign from the great beyond that I\\'m supposed to only be doing music, as that comes so naturally to me that it often feels effortless, even when it\\'s extremely hard and when it’s not working. But music still flows out of me, unless there is a bigger problem within myself. Writing is a true grind for me, but I like that about it. I like that it isn\\'t easy for me, I like defying the message from the universe saying \"You can\\'t do this-- you might as well go back to what you know.\" So I work harder for this than I am used to, I scrap a lot and start over, gut something and re-arrange, jumping all over the document constantly, getting new ideas and facing new challenges. I wonder how many people there are out there that writing comes extremely natural to, almost effortless. I imagine there are some, but it still has to be extremely hard. Most of what I have heard writers say is that it is extremely difficult no matter who you are. That is the craft I’m told, that is the life.\\nThe rewards of writing are slightly different, while at the same time sharing similarities to making music. The reward you get from pushing yourself past the breaking point but still holding it together, this happens with music too. But there is a specific satisfaction that comes from tackling something that feels a little out of your league at times.\\nEh- I think I\\'d rather be writing something than writing about writing something. What do I know? I go on instinct, I\\'m generally in the dark still about the whole process.\\nI have started to think about writing a book, a work of fiction. (I just noticed I\\'m writing about writing again). In a way, aside from being a dream come true writing Doom Patrol, I see it as training in a lot of ways, see if I can hold myself accountable for producing. And the morning pages are also a part of this.\\nBleh, more writing about writing. What is the fun in that-- no time to mess around with process-- time to go and put words on the page!\\nGEmbed': 663,\n",

The Henson Company has always been one of my favorite creative collectives, and the films of Jim Henson had an enormous impact on me as a child. I can't imagine anything like The Dark Crystal being made today, it almost seems an impossibility. It felt nice to do something for such a great organization, and I knew the lay of the land pretty well, as we had recorded there for months at one point. It was nice to build some new positive memories onto the place. And to receive the honor of performing a David Bowie song (2!) is an amazing feeling, as he was so important to me.\\nI have a headache today, I think from staying up too late last night (as I go to bed rather early these days being a parent) and overall excitement overload. I must write today-- always writing but I do love it. I think Saturday was the first time I have performed live in a long time, it felt good.\\nDreamlike.

       " \"Morning Pages: 10/17/16 LyricsAnother wonderful (and grey) Monday in Los Angeles. Listening to Plastic Beach by Gorillaz and gearing up for the week ahead. Deadlines this week. As monthly comic book creators, we find ourselves constantly in a situation where you must deliver no matter what it takes. This could mean waking up at 5:30am and going to bed at midnight, just grinding through the process. But it's fun! It really is brutal fun.\\nI've just begun my Transcendental Meditation training and I am loving it so far. I didn’t know if I was going to take to it right away but I did. I'm looking forward to learning more as I have three more classes. You should check it out and look it up. I found out about it from reading some of David Lynch's book, Catching The Big Fish. He has been a big supporter of TM for a very long time, and even has a foundation bringing tm to schools and other places.\\nI have been thinking about mental health recently. I'm not sure I want to go deep into it today, but it has been on my mind. I feel like there is a lot I can share on the subject, or offer a perspective as someone who has gone through all of the stages, from skepticism to denial, through acceptance, to willingness, and dedication to treatment. I will share more on this soon. One of the things I will absolutely be talking about, is the feeling that some people have, and that I had at one point, that treatment can endanger your creativity. In my experience, I could not agree less with this feeling. But it took trust, and an openness to trying new things. It is scary when you think about all of the things that make you who you are, even the issues you may have, and then wondering what will happen to the seemingly positive byproducts of these struggles. I clung onto these byproducts for a long time, and in some cases I pushed myself into nurturing them, which I found to be a dangerous activity. I promise more on this when I'm in the right headspace to talk about it, and I will most likely elaborate on this aspect.\\nWith Transcendental Meditation, you must engage in it two times a day, and I haven't done mine yet for today, so I am a little foggy. I'm going to go do that now in order to clear things up for the challenges ahead. I wish you a good morning, or evening, or whatever time it is where you are, and hope you accomplish what you want today.\\nG2Embed\": 791,\n",

       " '“You Can If You Want to” -  Why Willpower Can’t Cure Addiction LyricsA common thing many people battling substance addiction and even those close to them think is that if you want to get and stay sober, you can.\\xa0\\nThis belief often does more harm than good. Research has shown that addiction is a complicated disease that cannot be magically cured by willpower alone.\\xa0\\nHere are 5 reasons why you cannot win against addiction through sheer willpower:\\nA Firm Decision Is Not the Same as the Follow-Through\\nPeople struggling with an addiction might actually want to get better, and even showcase amazing willpower to do so. Howеver, wanting and firmly deciding to do it does not automatically mеan they will be able to keep away from their substance of choice, especially if they do not follow a comprehensive treatment plan.\\n\\n\\nAddiction Is Not a Choice\\nPeople might choose to try a certain substance at some point, but they do not choose to become addicted and continuously depend on said substance. Addiction cannot be controlled by simply deciding not to take part in these destructive behaviors. It’s something that’s outside a person’s control, therefore willpower cannot help them overcome it.\\n\\xa0\\nWillpower Does Not Address the Cause\\nPeople often become addicted to a substance because they are trying to self-medicate and push something away, such as pain or trauma. Deciding to get better does not address the root cause of why this behavior began in the first place, which increases the risks of relapse tremendously.\\n\\xa0\\nHuman Nature Is Not Fixed\\nEven if a person decides to get sober now, and believes in this decision with every fiber of their being, it doesn’t mean they will feel the same later on. Giving up a drug or alcohol can bring back many of the pain they were trying to avoid in the first place, which can make them think differently about their addiction and turn back to their substance of choice.\\n\\xa0\\nWillpower Can Be Alienating\\nThe success rate of addiction therapies is often dependent on a person’s system of support. If they believe sobriety is determined by willpower, they are less likely to ask for help because for them, they are the only ones who can truly help themselves. This process can be extremely alienating, even causing a person battling substance addiction to distance themselves from other people.\\n\\xa0\\nWillpower Is Not Always Bad\\nHaving the willpower and determination to stay sober and get better can certainly help the outcomes of addiction treatment. It can help them stay motivated even during the most difficult times of their treatment and overcome its challenges.\\nHowever, to say that sobriety is just determined by willpower is a recipe for disaster, and can end up creating further problems for the person battling addiction. Addiction is a complex disease that cannot be traced down to a simple cause, and neither does sobriety.

       " 'Morning Pages: 10/03/16 LyricsI love Monday mornings. I used to hate them but I have really grown fond of them over the years. I think the biggest reason I didn\\'t like them so much is because I really didn\\'t have a great time in school. I always felt like I could have been creating or doing something else. It would stress me out to be tied to a desk and trying to figure out things I was fairly sure I\\'d have no use for. I would play hooky and walk into the next town to the comic shop and see what was out. It would inspire me. I guess I just wasn\\'t very inspired in school. I think some of this had to do with knowing very early on in my life that I wanted to be some sort of artist, then, more specifically, a comic artist and writer, a musician. I just knew I wanted to be involved in the arts. So I only acquired skills I thought would help me with that. Looking back, there could have been a few more things I could have used in the math department, though I\\'m awful at it.\\nBy the time I got to my senior year, I was almost exclusively taking art classes, and in work study. So, I had one \"normal\" class in the morning, whatever that requirement was, then off to art for a solid chunk of the day, then I was allowed to leave school and go to work. I had figured out a way to drop out of gym class, so I didn\\'t need to fill that requirement for senior year. I could have probably used the exercise but I really couldn\\'t be bothered.\\nSo I entered the workforce early, I was already accepted into SVA by the time half the school year was over, so I was just phoning it in. I had actually entered the workforce earlier than that, at around 15 years old, where I worked for a catholic school uniform store. I handled the stock, and would often swipe patches and I bought myself a cardigan to wear to school. I wore that thing all the time.\\nCollege was eye opening. I think the greatest benefit to going was the first year, where the school required you to take every kind of art pretty much, even photography, where I got a D as a grade. I didn\\'t take to the camera well but I took to drawing and abstract painting. I wasn\\'t much good at sculpture either. I remember one of the assignments was that we had to construct a chair as an art piece. My work was so crummy that you couldn\\'t sit in the chair at all, and I chose this horrible floral pattern for the upholstery. It was really a monstrosity. The only thing I created in sculpture class that I ended up liking was part of the assignment involving casting and carving plaster. I decided to make a \"ghost log\". I carved this large chunk of plaster into something that looked like a cartoon log, and then gave it a dark wash and sanded the surfaces to expose the white plaster. I even wrote a song about it.\\n\"Deep in the woods, there was a ghost log...\". And so on.\\nToday\\'s assignments or possibilities: Umbrella Academy and Doom Patrol. With Umbrella, the 3rd series is worked out so it is only a matter of scripting the scenes and getting it off the Gabriel. With Doom, I need to dive into the next issue, but also plan out where the story is headed for the next year. I have a rough plan of this, as I\\'m flying a little bit by the seat of my pants, but it\\'s time to bring it in. The core concepts and beats are there though. The Umbrella Academy characters are old friends I know very well, but some of the Doom characters are new to me, though some of them I had been reading about for years, like Cliff Steele and Larry Trainor, so in a way they are old friends as well. Writing Cliff and Larry is very rewarding.\\nNew York Comicon is this week. I have a pretty light schedule which is good, so I can stay on top of my scripts at night, or during the day when I don\\'t have any obligations to fill. Will really be nice to walk around the city though, as it has been some time. If I miss anything about New York City, it is the walking. I remember moving to LA and trying to walk places and it was almost impossible, and people look at you like there is something wrong with you for walking. \"Nobody walks in LA\" as the Missing Persons song goes. It is really dead on. But NYC has an energy when you\\'re walking around, it gives back to you. Now that Doom Patrol is out, I am excited to meet people to see what they think of it, see if they have latched on to any characters this early, or where they think it is headed. It has been nice keeping my head down and just working through things, though it is pretty solitary.\\nAlright, I\\'m off to work. Lots of stories and beats and characters to figure out.\\nHope you have a great day, stay in school.\\nGEmbed': 968,\n",
